Duuude, just finished watching Borderline, and I gotta tell ya, my brain feels like it went through a blender. 🤯 I mean, where do I even start?! The plot was like this wild roller coaster that just kept adding more loops the longer you stayed on. One minute I'm all like, Oh, I get it, and then bam, full-on mind-swipe. Didn't see 90% of those plot twists coming. 😵

So, anyway, I'm still not sure if I loved it or if it's just gonna haunt my dreams forever. Haha. The main character though, seriously, what a ride. First, I'm rooting for them, then I'm like, Why? Just why would you do that? Some of the choices... ugh, you know what I mean? Just wild ride the whole way through.

> And this cinematography. Woah, dude, the colors and angles made it feel like I was part of the craziness. Are my eyeballs ever gonna recover? I need to download the movie just to screenshot every single scene. Each one felt like its own wacky piece of art, like, does that even make sense?!

But I gotta admit, the soundtrack slaps. It’s stuck in my head, and not in a bad way. Now I gotta find it, like, yesterday. 😂 If I can’t have the visuals at my fingertips, at least I’ll vibe to the music. And let’s talk about that ending for a sec. What even was that?! I'm still here trying to connect the dots, and all I got is a tangled mess.

Speaking of tangled messes, you have to watch the movie yourself, dude. So much to unpack with a friend or, I don’t know, a therapist maybe. 😂 It’s one of those flicks where every time you think you’ve peeked behind the curtain, there’s another curtain, just staring at you with judgment. Oh, and heads up—totally don’t try to make sense of it when you're already tired. Such a brain drain, yeesh.

int mindBlownLevel = 9999; // whatever, don’t even know why I’m putting this here, lol.

Alright, I should probably hit the hay before my brain just says “Enough!” Meanwhile, if you check it out, hit me up! Desperately need to rant/chat/try to unravel this thing with someone who gets it. 😂 Like, what even was that flight of fancy?
